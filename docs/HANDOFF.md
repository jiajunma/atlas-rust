# Atlas-Rust handoff - 2026-07-29 (B3c+B3d verified)

This is the continuation record for `/Users/hoxide/mycodes/atlas-rust`.
The goal is source-compatible Atlas language behavior, with the upstream Atlas
executable and CWEB sources as the behavior oracle. The core remains safe Rust.

## Current state

- Branch: `main`.
- B3a non-recursive functions, B3b recursive functions / definition sugar,
  B3c parameter patterns, and B3d selectors are implemented and
  differentially verified. The exact commit is shown by
  `git log -1 --oneline`.
- B4 loops, B5 set_type, B6 case/counted-for, and B7 misc commands have
  frozen reference events (captures `3498786`, `3499601`, `3499627`,
  `3499657`); the B4 implementation is in progress.
- No uncommitted repository changes should remain after the handoff commit.

The typed session pipeline is active: `session.rs` and `session_frame.rs`
convert/evaluate through `typed.rs`; the old dynamic `eval.rs` path is deleted.
The current typed surface includes scalar and linear values, subscriptions,
one-dimensional slices, matrix/vector/ratvec crossings, RootDatum/Cartan
constructors, the exposed KGB constructor adapter, and now non-recursive
functions: typed lambda literals `(int n): body`, parameterless `@: body`
closures with frame capture (including escaped captures), `return` intercepted
at the call boundary and rejected at analysis outside a function body,
identifier selector postfix `receiver.name` lowered to `name(receiver)`,
function-definition sugar `f(params): body` in `let`/`set` declarations,
`rec_fun` recursive functions in declaration and expression form with explicit
result types (the self binding lives in the argument frame), binding and
parameter patterns (tuple destructuring, discard `type .`, const `!x`,
whole-value `(a, b): t`) compiled to a shared `SlotShape` frame layout, and
operator/unit selectors (`2.-`, `2.3`) with operator selectors resolving
through the standard overload table. This is not a
claim of full Atlas compatibility: InnerClass/RealForm/KGB rendering and
numbering, relations, primitive `involution` constructors, loops, `set_type`,
and later math overloads remain pending differential evidence.

## Verified stage: B3c parameter patterns and B3d selectors

- `tests/fixtures/eval/patterns_b3c.atlas` (5 accepted lines: tuple
  destructuring bindings, discard `type .` parameters, const `!x` bindings,
  whole-value `(a, b): t` patterns) and
  `tests/fixtures/eval/patterns_b3c_rejected.atlas` (3 rejected lines:
  const assignment, two pattern shape mismatches). Implementation: `Pattern`
  AST with `SlotShape` frame layout shared by let groups and call frames
  (commit `83debd3`).
- `tests/fixtures/eval/selectors_b3d.atlas` (3 accepted lines: unit selector
  `().f`, chained identifier selectors `2.f.g`, operator selector `2.-`) and
  `tests/fixtures/eval/selectors_b3d_rejected.atlas` (2 rejected lines:
  `2.+` without a unary-plus overload, `2.3` calling a non-function).
  Implementation: selector callee variants identifier/operator/unit-literal,
  operator selectors reusing `OperatorCall` overload resolution (commit
  `f6a5e5c`).
- Oracle captures: B3c `3498578`, B3d `3498619`, both PASS against the
  frozen oracle.
- Differential: `pipeline_swap_diff` job `3499673` at commit `a938573`
  reports all four fixtures PASS (the same run reports `loops_b4` FAIL,
  expected: its implementation was still in flight).
- Reference metadata: `tests/reference/eval/patterns_b3c{,_rejected}.meta.json`
  and `selectors_b3d{,_rejected}.meta.json` carry
  `rust_status: verified_hpc` with `differential_job: 3499673`.

The bounded local checks for these stages:

- `cargo test -p atlas-core --lib`: 169 passed, 0 failed;
- `cargo clippy -p atlas-core --lib -- -D warnings`;
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` and `python3 hpc/test_pipeline_swap_diff.py`.

## Verified stage: B3a non-recursive functions

- `tests/fixtures/eval/functions_b3.atlas` (5 accepted lines) and
  `tests/fixtures/eval/functions_b3_rejected.atlas` (6 rejected lines: top-level
  return, argument type mismatch, wrong arity as void-vs-pattern, calling a
  non-function, missing-colon lambda syntax error, undefined selector target).
- Oracle capture: HPC jobs `3498312` (accepted) and `3498466` (rejected),
  both PASS against the frozen `/public/home/majj/atlasofliegroups-4d3e9449`
  checkout (revision `4d3e9449062a07c1c85f4e6df215eb6ccc0eeae9`, binary sha256
  `66f5d7d4...`, submitted with `ATLAS_BIN` and
  `EXPECTED_ATLAS_BINARY_SHA256=66f5d7d47d560e616363392b38205166d1579985dc7337cc95ba4cae50be65c9`).
- Differential: `pipeline_swap_diff` job `3498527` reports both fixtures PASS
  (stdout/exit/diagnostics exact; suite remains PARTIAL only for the known
  `pipeline_swap_domain_equality` pending cases).
- Reference metadata: `tests/reference/eval/functions_b3{,_rejected}.meta.json`
  carry the capture provenance and `rust_status: verified_hpc` with
  `differential_job: 3498527`.

The bounded local checks for this stage:

- `cargo test -p atlas-core --lib`: 154 passed, 0 failed;
- `cargo clippy -p atlas-core --lib -- -D warnings`;
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, JSON validation of the reference files, and
  `python3 hpc/test_pipeline_swap_diff.py`.

Only bounded local checks are appropriate here. The project policy puts full
workspace tests, Atlas/CWEB execution, differential jobs, and benchmarks on
XMU HPC.

## Verified stage: B3b recursive functions and definition sugar

- `tests/fixtures/eval/functions_b3b.atlas` (6 accepted lines: single- and
  multi-parameter definition sugar, `rec_fun` in declaration and expression
  form with explicit result types, parameterless sugar, recursive closures
  capturing their `let` scope) and
  `tests/fixtures/eval/functions_b3b_rejected.atlas` (3 rejected lines: body
  type error under sugar, recursive call with mismatched argument type,
  recursive declaration missing its result type).
- Oracle capture: HPC job `3498562`, PASS against the frozen oracle.
- Differential: `pipeline_swap_diff` job `3498653` at commit `f773695`
  reports both fixtures PASS.
- Reference metadata: `tests/reference/eval/functions_b3b{,_rejected}.meta.json`
  carry `rust_status: verified_hpc` with `differential_job: 3498653`.
- The bison expecting-list after `syntax error, unexpected IF` is not
  asserted; only the offending token is (see `docs/DESIGN.md` on diagnostic
  wording vs semantic equality).

The bounded local checks for this stage:

- `cargo test -p atlas-core --lib`: 160 passed, 0 failed;
- `cargo clippy -p atlas-core --lib -- -D warnings`;
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, JSON validation of the reference files, and
  `python3 hpc/test_pipeline_swap_diff.py`.

## HPC operations notes (verified this stage)

- The submit checkout must be clean at the declared commit. A previous job's
  root-level Slurm stdout (`atlas-*-<jobid>.out`) is untracked and makes the
  next submission dirty; move it away before resubmitting. The same applies to
  stale untracked sources (an old `eval.rs` leftover blocked one sync).
- The frozen oracle `/public/home/majj/atlasofliegroups-4d3e9449` is a git
  checkout at the pinned revision and must stay clean: job `3498017` failed
  because legacy `oracle-results/` and copied fixture files were left inside
  it (now in `/tmp/atlas-oracle-trash` on the login node). The unpinned
  `/public/home/majj/atlasofliegroups` tree is no longer a git repository and
  its binary differs from every pin; do not use it for captures.
- `reference_capture.sbatch` fails before the harness when declared and
  detected source state differ; the FAIL fallback report names the phase.
- After any commit that touches `crates/`, a subsequent rsync that excludes
  `crates/` (while a background agent holds uncommitted changes) leaves the
  remote checkout dirty against its HEAD, and a capture submitted in that
  window records `dirty_tree: true`. Repair with
  `git archive HEAD crates | ssh ... tar -x -C <remote>` before submitting,
  and re-capture anything taken in the dirty window (job `3499634` was
  re-taken as `3499638`).

## Next implementation slice (B4 loops in flight, then B5/B6/B7)

In rough dependency order, each with its own fixture + HPC capture first:

1. B4 loops (`while`/`for`, `break` without value). Reference events frozen
   (capture `3498786`, commit `a5856a1`): loops collect each iteration's body
   value into a row; the breaking iteration contributes nothing;
   `while do ... od` loops until `break`; `for x@i` binds the loop index.
   Implementation in progress.
2. B5 `set_type` (capture `3499601`, commit `559f363`): the single-name form
   defines aliases plus projector/injector overloads but cannot support
   `case` discrimination; only the bracketed `set_type [ ... ]` form enters
   types into the tabled type map (required by discrimination and
   recursion); union values display as `value.tag`; tabled types print by
   name in `whattype`; `expr : type` ascription is a syntax error.
3. B6 case and counted for (capture `3499627`, commit `cfdd9cc`): integer
   case selects in-list branches by 0-based index with remainder wrapping;
   else catches out-of-range, then catches negative; positional union case
   branches are functions; counted `for i: n from m`/`downto`; `e1 next e2`
   collects e1.
4. B7 misc commands (capture `3499657`, commit `21ee423`): `forget` of
   unknown identifiers and of single overloads, `die` as a runtime
   diagnostic with batch continuation, coercion fallback after overload
   removal. The `whattype id_op ?` overload listing is deferred until the
   domain types appearing in builtin lists are ported.

Before continuing, run the smallest local parser/core check with the project
toolchain, then sync a clean committed tree to HPC and submit the relevant
SLURM job. Record the job id, reference revision, source commit, dirty state,
fixture manifest, exit code, and checksums in the reference metadata/report.

## Local environment

- `rustup` is installed through Homebrew.
- Stable toolchain: Rust 1.96.0; project `rust-toolchain.toml` selects stable
  and requires clippy/rustfmt.
- Rust 1.90.0 is also installed for the repository's earlier local gate.
- `rust-analyzer` is installed at `/opt/homebrew/bin/rust-analyzer`.
- `~/.cargo/bin` now precedes `/opt/local/bin` in `~/.zprofile`, so new shells
  use rustup's `rustc`, `cargo`, `clippy`, and `rustfmt` proxies. Restart the
  shell or source `~/.zprofile` before checking versions.

## Standing rules

- Read `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`, `docs/LANGUAGE.md`, and `docs/DESIGN.md` before
  changing language behavior.
- Add/update fixture and reference metadata before implementation claims.
- Never hand-edit generated CWEB or parser output.
- Keep root-data and real-group invariants in their owned domain layer.
- Preserve unrelated user changes and do not commit unverified HPC output.
